# ðŸŽ® Simon-Says-Game

ðŸ§  About the Game

In Simon Says, a sequence of button flashes (colors) is generated by the game. Your goal is to repeat the same sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons in the same order. With each round, the sequence gets longer â€” testing how far your memory can go!
